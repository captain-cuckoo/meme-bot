# Meme Bot

## I'm so sorry you have to see this

# How to setup

```pip install -r requirements.py```

Replace token with your bot token in bot.py
```token = "BOT_TOKEN"```
and create a imgflip account from https://imgflip.com/signup and put in the username and password in meme.py (their api fucking sucks)
```
username = 'username' #imgur account username
password = 'password' #imgur account password
```
